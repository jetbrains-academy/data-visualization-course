Histograms are a powerful way to visualize the distribution of continuous data. Rather than comparing separate
categories, they illustrate how data points spread across a continuous scale. By dividing the range of values into
bins (intervals) on the horizontal axis, you can quickly see where the data cluster, whether there’s a skew toward
higher or lower values, and if there are any outliers or unusual peaks. Histograms are especially useful for large
datasets, providing a concise overview of the distribution without the need to inspect every individual data point.

When Bruno was offered a promotion, his task appeared straightforward: analyze years of rainfall data. However, faced
with endless rows of numbers, he didn’t know where to start. Sensing his frustration, a colleague introduced him to
histograms, explaining how they group data into intervals to uncover meaningful patterns. Armed with this new
perspective, Bruno transformed the raw numbers into clear insights, impressing his supervisor and proving he was ready
for greater responsibility.
