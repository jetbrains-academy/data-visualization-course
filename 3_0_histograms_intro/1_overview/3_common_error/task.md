A common mistake when creating histograms is truncating the Y-axis, starting it above zero or otherwise altering its
scale. This can lead to misleading interpretations, since even minor differences between bins can appear exaggerated.

Although Bruno was adept at interpreting histograms, he fell into this trap when tasked by a local bakery owner to
visualize daily croissant sales. Wanting to emphasize changes, he began counting from `50` instead of `0`, prompting the
bakery owner to consider shifting production schedules based on the seemingly large variations. However, a closer look
at the raw data revealed these differences were actually minor. Realizing his oversight, Bruno restored the Y-axis to
accurately reflect the true distribution of sales, ensuring his chart provided a faithful representation of the bakery’s
performance.
