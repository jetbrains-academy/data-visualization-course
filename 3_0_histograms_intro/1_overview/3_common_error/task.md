A common mistake when creating histograms is truncating the Y-axis,
starting it above zero or otherwise altering its scale.
This can lead to misleading interpretations, since even minor differences between bins can appear exaggerated.

One day, the company where Jonsi works was approached by a chain of croissant stores. 
They wanted to analyze their typical daily croissant sales to optimize costs. 
A colleague of Jonsi made a mistake: when building the histogram, 
he incorrectly set the Y-axis to start above zero, unintentionally exaggerating minor differences between bins. 
This made small variations in croissant sales appear large and significant. 
Jonsi pointed out this issue, corrected the scale of the Y-axis, 
and clearly demonstrated that the actual sales data showed no significant differences, 
helping the company avoid unnecessary business decisions.
