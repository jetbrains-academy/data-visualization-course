While bar charts are best for comparing values across discrete or categorical variables, histograms focus on continuous
data. In a bar chart, each bar represents a distinct category, often with gaps to highlight their discrete nature. By
contrast, histogram bins typically touch, reflecting that the data values lie on a continuous scale. This visual
distinction indicates you’re examining ranges rather than separate categories.

Scatter plots may also be used to visualize data distributions, particularly when working with 2D or 3D
datasets. In the case of 1D data, a scatter plot does not effectively convey density information. However,
it can still be valuable for identifying outliers that might otherwise be absorbed into histogram bins. To partially
address the density limitation in 1D, one can reduce the opacity of points—areas with higher concentrations will appear
darker due to overlap, providing a rough visual cue of data density. This is why scatter plots often appear as a
follow-up in more advanced analysis steps.

After his promotion, Jonsi was assigned to analyze customer spending at a local cafe. At first, he tried a bar chart,
but it quickly became cluttered with individual purchase amounts. Realizing it wasn’t suited for continuous data, he
switched to a histogram, grouping spending into price ranges. Later, to explore unusual spending behaviors, he added a
1D scatter plot on top—helping him spot outliers that the histogram had smoothed over.
