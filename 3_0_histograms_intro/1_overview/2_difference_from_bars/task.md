While bar charts are best for comparing values across discrete or categorical variables, histograms focus on continuous
data. In a bar chart, each bar represents a distinct category, often with gaps to highlight their discrete nature. By
contrast, histogram bins typically touch, reflecting that the data values lie on a continuous scale. This visual
distinction indicates you’re examining ranges rather than separate categories.

continuous data, he switched to a histogram, grouping spending into price ranges—an adjustment that made it far easier
to spot common spending patterns.
