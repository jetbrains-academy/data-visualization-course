While bar charts are best for comparing values across discrete or categorical variables, 
histograms focus on continuous data.
In a bar chart, each bar represents a distinct category, often with gaps to highlight their discrete nature.
By contrast, histogram bins typically touch, reflecting that the data values lie on a continuous scale.
This visual distinction indicates you’re examining ranges rather than separate categories.

After his promotion, Jonsi was assigned to analyze customer spending at a local cafe. 
At first, he tried a bar chart, but it quickly became cluttered with individual purchase amounts. 
Realizing his mistake, he switched to a histogram, grouping spending into price ranges. 
This revealed clear patterns in customer behavior -- spending tended to cluster around certain price points, 
highlighting popular item combinations and helping the cafe adjust its menu and pricing strategy more effectively.
