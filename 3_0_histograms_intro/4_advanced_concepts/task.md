# Advanced Histogram Concepts

As Andy grew more experienced at the weather station, he discovered that basic histograms weren't always enough. Sometimes he needed more sophisticated tools to understand complex weather patterns.

## Andy's Advanced Toolkit

1. **Density Estimation**
   When comparing rainfall patterns across different regions:
   - Area of each bar shows proportion of data
   - Total area equals 1
   - Perfect for comparing cities with different numbers of weather stations

2. **Cumulative Histograms**
   Essential for tracking yearly rainfall totals:
   - Shows running totals throughout the year
   - Helps predict drought conditions
   - Perfect for comparing against historical averages

3. **2D Histograms**
   Andy's secret weapon for understanding temperature-humidity relationships:
   - Shows how two variables interact
   - Color intensity reveals common weather conditions
   - Crucial for predicting phenomena like fog and frost
