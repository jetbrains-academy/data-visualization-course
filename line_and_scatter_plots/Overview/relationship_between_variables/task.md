# Relationship between variables

Scatterplots are ideal when you want to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. They show the
distribution of individual data points and help identify patterns, correlations, clusters, or outliers. On the other
hand, line plots are suitable for showing the change in a single continuous variable over time or another continuous
variable.

Let's say Andy was assigned to define relationship between variables `x` and `y`, but Andy can't see the relationship just
looking at the numbers in the table. So he decided to plot them using a scatter plot. After a while, he noticed that if
you connect the points, the graph looks like a parabola! So the relationship was pretty easy: `y = x^2`
