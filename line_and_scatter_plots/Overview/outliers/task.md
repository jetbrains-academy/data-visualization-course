# Outliers

If you suspect the presence of outliers in your data, a scatterplot is better suited to identify them. Outliers can be
visible as data points that significantly deviate from the general trend. Conversely, line plots may not clearly exhibit
outliers as they continuously connect data points.

While searching for his first job, Andy came across a job with an average salary of <span>&#36;</span>3,000! Immediately
he went for an interview where he received an offer. Andy happily signed all the documents without reading them. And
after a month of hard working he finally receive to his bank account... <span>&#36;</span>500. Andy was confused. Since
he had access to all the salaries in the company, he decided to build a scatter plot with them and discovered the
outlier!  It was a CEO whose salary was much higher than the other employees. Because of this, the average salary was
higher than the actual one. Andy was angry and never worked for that company again… and since then, he's been reading
every document he signs.
