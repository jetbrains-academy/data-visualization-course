# Data distribution

If you want to visualize the overall patterns or the distribution of data, a scatterplot is more suitable. It allows you
to see the spread, clusters, and concentration of data points. Line plots are more focused on displaying changes and 
trends in the data over time or another continuous variable.

One day Andy needed to analyze data on the size of beavers. He calculated the simplest descriptive statistics, but they 
looked too perfect: the mean was 0 and the standard deviation was 1. Andy realized that something was wrong and decided 
to plot all the observations on a scatterplot... and got a smiley face. It was an April Fool's Day prank. Andy doesn't 
like pranks.
