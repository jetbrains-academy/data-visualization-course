## Theory

## Task

Modify the `plot` function by replacing a `scatter` call with `plot`. 
Note that you now don't need to make the plot transparent and colorize it.

## Hints

<div class="hint" title="How the figure should look like?">
<img src="example.png" alt="How the figure should look like" style="max-height: 500px">
</div>
