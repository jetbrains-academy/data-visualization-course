## Theory

The figure looks overwhelming at first sight and is not understandable at all. Let's tune the visualization parameters
a bit.

## Task

Color the line `firebrick` and set the scatter transparency to `0.1`.

## Hints

<div class="hint" title="How the figure should look like?">
   <img src="example.png" alt="How the figure should look like" style="max-height: 500px">
</div>
