# Data distribution

Histograms are typically used when you want to represent the frequency distribution of quantitative, continuous
variables. They are particularly useful when you have large data sets and need to understand the distribution of the
data, uncover any outliers, or identify any skewness in your data distribution. Histograms group data into bins and
provide a visual representation of data distribution.
