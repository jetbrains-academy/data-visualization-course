# Data Visualization in Python

This course is designed for beginners in data visualization 
and focuses on building visual representations using Python’s [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html#) libraries.

It is a self-contained course, but basic Python knowledge 
— such as working with variables, loops, and functions — is expected. 
Familiarity with the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/index.html) library is helpful but not required: 
data handling is mostly done behind the scenes to let you focus on the visual side.

Each lesson is structured as a small hands-on project: 
step by step, you’ll build real charts and develop practical visualization skills. 
Theory is kept to the point — most of the time, you’ll be learning by doing.

The course does not cover advanced statistics or machine learning. 
Instead, it introduces you to the fundamental chart types, 
explains when to use them, and shows how to build them effectively.

After this course, you’ll be able to confidently choose, build, 
and customize charts to tell clear and insightful stories with your data.

## Course modules

The course includes one introductory module and three core modules, each focusing on a different type of chart:
* Line and Scatter Plots.
  This module introduces you to the basics of data visualization using line and scatter plots — 
  the two most fundamental chart types for exploring relationships between variables.

* Bar and Pie Charts.
  In this module, you’ll shift your focus to categorical data and how to compare groups effectively.

* Histograms. 
  The third module focuses on visualizing distributions — 
  a key step in understanding the shape, skewness, and spread of your data.
