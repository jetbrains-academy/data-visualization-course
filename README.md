# Data Visualization with Python

This course is designed for beginners in data visualization 
and focuses on building visual representations using Python’s [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html#) libraries.

It is a self-contained course, but basic Python knowledge 
— such as working with variables, loops, and functions — is expected. 
Familiarity with the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/index.html) library is helpful but not required: 
data handling is mostly done behind the scenes to let you focus on the visual side.

Each lesson is structured as a small hands-on project: 
step by step, you’ll build real charts and develop practical visualization skills. 
Theory is kept concise — most of the time, you’ll learn by doing.

The course does not cover advanced statistics or machine learning. 
Instead, it introduces the fundamental chart types,
explains when to use them, and shows how to build them effectively.

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to confidently choose, create,
and customize charts to convey clear and insightful stories with your data.

## Course modules

The course includes one introductory module and three core modules, each focusing on a different type of chart:
* Line and Scatter Plots.
  This module introduces the basics of data visualization using line and scatter plots —
  two fundamental chart types for exploring relationships between variables.

* Bar and Pie Charts.
  In this module, you’ll focus on visualizing categorical data and learn how to effectively compare groups.

* Histograms. 
  The third module centers on visualizing distributions —
  a key step in understanding the shape, skewness, and spread of your data.
