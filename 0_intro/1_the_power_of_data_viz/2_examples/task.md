It’s very easy to see how crucial poignant visualization is on many examples.
Let’s take and old one and a modern one.

The classical one is [Florence Nightingale's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale) Rose Diagram.
Florence Nightingale was a 19th century statistician and a nurse who got her notoriety from pioneering modern nursing.
One way she did this was by producing "Diagram of the causes of mortality in the army in the East" –
a detailed and thoughtful visualization of the losses of the British army in the Crimean war in 1854–1856.
By showing the proportions of soldiers dying from epidemic disease rather than battle wounds,
she made a case for better sanitation, and the clear data visualization made her point direct and effective.

As a modern example, we can pick not a particular chart but rather a class of charts
that we recently saw everywhere: coronavirus cases.
While keeping track of the numbers in the case of a pandemic is crucial,
numbers quickly became overwhelming, especially given their tragic nature.
However, simple and clear visualizations allowed people to see the trends, realize the seriousness of the situation, 
and clearly see the “waves” of the virus and the impacts of its different variants.
