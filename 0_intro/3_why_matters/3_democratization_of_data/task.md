Not less importantly, the data is not only voluminous, it is also available. 
People have more access to data than they ever did in history, 
and this also means that the data has to be made understandable not just to professional stockholders, 
but also to non-technical users. For the same example of the stock market, 
while it sometimes needs to be visualized fully for the CEOs and big banks, it also requires much simpler, 
more straightforward visualizations for people who just care about their moderate investments.

Similarly, data visualization allows for political campaigning that explains the issues to the voters more clearly than it was possible before.
