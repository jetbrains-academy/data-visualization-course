The course consists of several modules, each focusing on one or two types of charts.

The first module covers line and scatter plots. 
These charts are used to explore relationships between variables,
reveal trends over time, identify outliers, and understand data distributions.

The second module introduces bar and pie charts, 
which are ideal for comparing categories and visualizing proportions within or between groups.
These charts work best when the number of categories is limited and clearly defined.

The third module focuses on histograms, which are used to examine the distribution of continuous data. 
Unlike bar charts, histograms show how values are grouped along a numeric scale. 
This makes them especially useful for identifying patterns, skewness, and density.

We recommend completing the modules in order, without skipping, 
as later modules often build on concepts introduced in earlier ones.

Each module includes an overview part explaining when and why to use a particular type of chart. 
There are also theory and practice lessons. 
In the theory lessons, we explore new plotting techniques and build charts step by step. 
In the practice lessons, you’ll apply your knowledge by creating charts on your own.

Each module's overview is based on a particular story from Jonsi's life. He is a data analyst who faces a lot of
challenges in his work.
