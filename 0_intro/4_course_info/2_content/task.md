The course consists of several modules, each of which covers one or two types of charts.

The first module focuses on line and scatter plots. 
These are used to explore relationships between variables,
reveal trends over time, identify outliers, and understand data distributions.

The second module introduces bar and pie charts, 
which are suitable for comparing categories and visualizing proportions within or between groups.
These charts work best when the number of categories is limited and clearly defined.

The third module covers histograms, which are used to examine the distribution of continuous data. 
Unlike bar charts, histograms show how values are grouped along a numeric scale, 
making them especially useful for spotting patterns, skewness, and density.

We recommend completing the modules in order, without skipping, 
as later modules often build on concepts introduced earlier in the course.

Inside each module, you can find an overview part explaining when and why to use a particular type of chart. 
There are also theory and practice lessons. 
In the theory ones, we explore new plotting techniques and build charts step by step. 
In the practice lessons, you’ll apply what you’ve learned by creating charts on your own.
