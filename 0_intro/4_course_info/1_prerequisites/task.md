The course is designed with no specific prerequisites.
The only requirement is a basic understanding of Python — including variables, loops, and functions.
If you're not familiar with Python yet, we recommend taking our "[Introduction to Python](https://academy.jetbrains.com/course/16630-introduction-to-python)" course.

Throughout this course, we also use the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library for working with data.
However, you don't need to know Pandas in advance — 
we use hidden helper functions that handle the data processing logic for you, 
so we can focus purely on data visualization.
That said, we encourage you to get comfortable with Pandas before or after taking the course,
as it's widely used in the field of data science.
You can learn it using our "[Gateway to Pandas](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22686-gateway-to-pandas)" course.

If you’d like to go beyond the scope of the course
you're welcome to write your own data processing code with Pandas — 
just note that any custom logic won’t be checked by the automated tests.
