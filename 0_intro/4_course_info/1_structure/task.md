The course consist of several modules each of which covering one or two types of graphs.

The first module covers line and scatter plots ...

The second module covers bar and pie chart ...

The third module covers histograms ...

Each module consist of three parts.

The first one is the theory part where we describe when and why plot тот или иной type of chart. 
Each case described with a small story from the life of Jonsi a data visualization nerd.

Other two parts covers two different libraries: matplotlib and seaborn. 
We designed this course so each library part would be independent from each other.
If you are new in data visualization then we suggest starting with seaborn track and then go with matplotlib.
We suggest you to not pass the seaborn track and matplotlib track at the same time
Matplotlib is a data visualization library that allows you to plot almost anything proving rich customization features,
but it comes with a more difficult API and you need to spend some time to get the chart that you want
Seaborn is a wrapper upon Matplotlib, it provides you with a simpler API and the ability to plot the beautiful chart right out of the box but it comes with a really poor customizability

In each track we have theory and practical lessons. In theory lesson we together step-by-step learns new features and plot some charts and in the practice lesson you can apply new knowledge to plot the chart on your own.

Each task has tests that checks your code, you can also check the resulting graph with the example that specified in the corresponding hint for each task

The only prerequisites to the course are:
1. The basic knowledge of Python
2. Willing to learn data viz :-)

In the course we use Pandas as a wrapper and helper with different datasets,
you don't need to know much of it as we prepared the hidden wrappers.

We did it because the goal of this course is not to teach you pandas or any other data libraries but when and how to visualize the data.
But you are willing to write your own pandas functions fell free to do it, but they won't be tested.

Each task has a hints in case if you are stuck.
