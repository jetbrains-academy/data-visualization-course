In this course, we use two libraries for data visualization: [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). 
Each has its own dedicated learning track. 

If you're new to data visualization, we suggest starting with Seaborn. 
It offers a simpler API and produces attractive charts with minimal effort. 
However, it has limited customization options, which can be a constraint for more advanced visualizations.

Matplotlib, on the other hand, is a more powerful and flexible library. 
It allows you to create almost any type of chart with fine-grained control over every element. 
But this power comes with a steeper learning curve, and you'll need to invest more time to achieve the desired results.

Although both tracks are designed to be independent and can be completed in any order, 
we advise against taking them simultaneously. 
Focusing on one library at a time will help you build a clearer understanding and avoid confusion between the two APIs.
