Early visualization wasn't born in the digital era—it has deep roots.
In the 17th century, artists and scientists began crafting hand‐drawn maps 
and simple charts that captured geographic and astronomical data. 
These early efforts laid a conceptual foundation by showing that 
visual representations could convey complex information much more intuitively than raw numbers. 
For example, early cartographers used rudimentary maps to depict territories, 
while early scientific diagrams began to illustrate relationships between data points.
