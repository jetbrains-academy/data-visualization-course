## Theory

Here we have not so many classes, and it could be more convenient to represent the same data in the form of Pie chart,
because the proportion is more relevant for us rather than the absolute values. Unfortunately, `seaborn` doesn't have a
distinct method for creating Pie charts, but Pandas can.
