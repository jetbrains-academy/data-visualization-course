# Trend analysis

If you're interested in examining trends, a line plot is generally more effective.
It displays data in a connected line, making it easier to identify long-term patterns and changes over time.
If you have a dataset with a time dimension, a line plot allows for a chronological representation of the data.

One day, Andy tried to predict the price of “Success” LLC to decide whether to invest some of his money in it.
He plotted a graph of the company's stock price and saw that every fall in share price was followed by a rise.
Andy concluded that the company's share price would continue to rise, so he purchased shares.
It worked!
After a month, the company's price rose dramatically, and Andy made a significant profit.
