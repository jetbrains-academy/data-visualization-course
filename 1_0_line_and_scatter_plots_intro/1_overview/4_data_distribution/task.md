# Data distribution

If you want to visualize overall patterns or the distribution of data, a scatterplot is more suitable.
It allows you to see the spread, clusters, and concentration of data points.
Line plots, on the other hand, are more focused on displaying changes and trends in the data over time.

One day, Andy needed to analyze data on the size of beavers.
He calculated the simplest descriptive statistics, but the results seemed too perfect:
the mean was 0, and the standard deviation was 1.
Sensing that something was wrong, Andy decided to plot all the observations on a scatterplot...
and saw a smiley face.
It was an April Fool's Day prank.
Andy doesn't like pranks.
