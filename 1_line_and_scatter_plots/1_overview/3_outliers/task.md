# Outliers

If you suspect the presence of outliers in your data, a scatterplot is better suited to identify them. Outliers can be 
visible as data points that significantly deviate from the general trend. Conversely, line plots may not clearly exhibit
outliers as they continuously connect data points.

While searching for his first job, Andy came across a job with an average salary of $3,000! He immediately went for an 
interview where he received an offer. Andy happily signed all the documents without reading them. After a month of hard 
work he finally received the salary… 500$. Andy was confused. Since he had access to all the salaries in the company,
he decided to build a scatter plot with them and discovered the outlier!  It was the CEO whose salary was much higher 
than the other employees. Because of this, the average salary was much higher than the actual one. Andy was angry and 
never worked for that company again… and since then, he's been reading every document he signs.
