## Theory

As we can see... we can see nothing. It's all because of very huge values which we have in our dataset. Let's firstly
analyse them and then determine the range that we need.

|       | global_sales |
|:------|-------------:|
| count |        14294 |
| mean  |      0.59205 |
| std   |      1.66266 |
| min   |         0.01 |
| 25%   |         0.06 |
| 50%   |         0.19 |
| 75%   |         0.54 |
| max   |        82.53 |

As we predicted, while the mean and std are about 0.6, 1, the maximum value is about 82! For further analysis let's
select the values which lay in the range until 95 percentile (or quantile 0.95).
