# Comparison of categories

When working with discrete or qualitative variables, bar or pie charts are effective for visualizing differences or
similarities between categories. They work best with a limited number of categories to prevent clutter and improve
interpretability. If you have a large number of categories, consider grouping or summarizing them for clarity. Bar
charts are particularly useful for displaying proportions or percentages within categories, as the scaled height of the
bars facilitates easy comparison and clear visualization of distribution.

Introducing Bruno, a data analyst, whose early career challenge involved assisting a local farm. The farm had to scale
back
production after some of their cattle escaped.
The farm wanted to focus on producing only the most popular types of cheeses. Andy organized a tasting day and used bar
charts to visualize the popularity of each cheese type among participants, effectively guiding the farm’s decision on
which cheeses to continue producing.
