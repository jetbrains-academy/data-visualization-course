# Proportions of a whole

Pie charts are best used to show proportions or percentages of a whole. If the focus is on the individual contribution
of each category rather than a direct comparison between categories, a pie chart can help highlight those proportions.

Bruno recently reviewed his personal finances to save for a vacation. He used a pie chart to analyze his monthly
expenses. As expected, most of his spending went towards rent and groceries. However, he was surprised by the
substantial amount spent on entertainment, such as games and streaming subscriptions. Realizing he seldom used these
services, Bruno decided to reduce these expenses, aiding his progress towards his savings goal.
