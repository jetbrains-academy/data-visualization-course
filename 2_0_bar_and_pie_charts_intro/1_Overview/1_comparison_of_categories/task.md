# Comparison of categories

If your data involves discrete or qualitative variables, a bar or pie chart can offer a clear representation of the
differences or similarities between categories. But they work best only when dealing with a limited number of
categories, as too many categories can make the chart cluttered and difficult to interpret. If you have a large number
of categories, consider grouping or summarizing them to maintain clarity in the visual representation.
